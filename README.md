# How To Write a USEFUL README On Github

A well-written README can significantly enhance the usability and attractiveness of a project beyond just serving as a piece of documentation. Here are detailed steps on how to structure an effective README:

1. **Strong H1 Title and H2 Subtitle**: Start with a compelling title and subtitle. These should be crafted to attract both search engines and human readers. The title doesn't necessarily have to be the project’s name, but including it can be beneficial.

2. **Intro Paragraph**: Provide a clear and concise introduction explaining what the project is, what it does, and its purpose. This section serves both SEO purposes and helps users quickly understand the project's value.

3. **Diagram (Optional)**: Include a diagram if it helps illustrate the project’s functionality or where it fits within a larger system. For CLI or graphical tools, consider adding an animated GIF or a YouTube video demo to showcase the project in action. This can be very effective in attracting more users.

4. **Installation and Usage Instructions (for End-Users)**: Offer detailed instructions on how to install and use the project. This section is crucial for users who have shown interest and want to try out the project. Ensure the instructions are clear and easy to follow, but do not mix this with contributions instructions.

5. **Installation and Usage Instructions (for Contributors)**: Differentiate the instructions for contributors who want to help improve the project. This section should guide them on how to pull the code and set up the development environment. Include details on building from source if necessary and make the process as easy as possible to encourage contributions.

6. **Contributor Expectations**: Clearly define the guidelines and expectations for contributors. This section should explain the process for submitting issues and pull requests, any specific requirements like squashed commits, and whether you have templates for pull requests. Setting these ground rules helps streamline contributions and ensures everyone is on the same page.

7. **Known Issues**: Maintain a list of known issues to prevent users from reporting problems you are already aware of. This helps manage user expectations and reduces redundant bug reports.

By following these steps, you can create a README that not only provides essential information but also enhances the overall user and contributor experience, potentially leading to a more successful and collaborative project.
